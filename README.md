# 💻 Java Learning  Guide – Topic-wise Java Programs for Absolute Beginners ☕🚀

Welcome to the **Java Learning Guide**!  
This repository is a complete resource for anyone who wants to start learning Java through **simple, practical, and well-organized programs**.

It covers all the **core concepts of Java**, broken down topic-by-topic with **10+ beginner-level programs for each topic** — so you can build your foundation step by step.

## ✨ Why This Project?

When I started learning Java, I often struggled with:
- What to practice?
- Where to begin?
- How to build logical thinking?

So I decided to **create this structured repository** with beginner-friendly programs in each topic, written with clear logic and comments, to help others who are starting just like I did.
